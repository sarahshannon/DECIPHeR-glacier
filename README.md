# Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology DECIPHeR-glacier
This is the code accompanying the paper

A snow and glacier hydrological model for large catchments â€“ case study for the Naryn River, Central Asia, HESS Discussions, 2022
https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2022-51/

DECIPHeR-glacier contains a degree day snow and glacier melt model described in the paper. The code is configured to run for the Naryn catchment,
Kyrgyzstan. Some changes are required to model another catchment.

The code was deveoped by Sarah Shannon (sarah.shannon@bristol.ac.uk) at the University of Bristol as part of the Leverhume funded project on glaci
er melting and water security in Central Asia (https://centralasiawater.blog)
